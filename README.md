# Hello Wiki Search 
This application is used to search for word online and return first sentence found and also inluded proper error handling

## Application environments
This application is created to run on multiple environment
1. AWS Lambda function (FAAS)
2. local (Virtual environment) using click middleware for input and argument and porper visual response

### AWS LAMBDA 
1. Create an account with aws
2. Create a Cloud9 (IDE) environment so as to leverage on the SAM CLI for LAMBDA function created by aws or install SAM CLI locally
3. Clone this repo 
4. Run `sam init` to get started, follow the instruction and build your starter template for you application 
5. Copy `lambda_app.py` to app.py under the `hello_world folder` generated by `sam int command`
6. Navigate to helloworld folder dir and create a virtual environment 
7. Copy content on `requirement.txt` and paste on helloword/requirement.txt
8. Create A file payload.json in the same root of the hello_world folder and paste the payload.json you cloned
9. Run `sam build` to build your build/bundle your file together 
10. Run `sam local invoke -e payload.json`
11. Run `sam build --guided` to host on lambda, the command will generate all the necessary resources to deploy to production environment.
12. Go aws lambda, search for your lamda and test.

### Local (Virtual Environment)
1. Install python3 and pip
2. Create a folder and clone the repo
3. Create a virtaul environment and activate `the step will be explain below"
4. Upgrade pip and install requirements.txt `python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt -y`
5. Run `python app.py <argument>` example:  `python app.py twitter`


### virtual Environment
#### Create a Virtual Environment and activate
```
  python3 -m venv ~/.hello
  source  ~/.hello/bin/activate
```
#### Upgrade and install packages
```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Sam Commands

```
# Lambda initialisation
 sam init

# Lamda build 
  sam build

# Lambda invoke locally
  sam local invoke

# Lambda invoke locally  with payload
  sam local invoke -e <payload.json>

#lambda build to production
